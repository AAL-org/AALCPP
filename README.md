Dont. Just Dont.

## How does it work?
1. Javascript reads your aal file, tokenizing it.
2. Those tokens are read by the **SAME FILE** making that process pointless.
3. The same file then converts those tokens into C++.
4. That C++ file is then compiled by node (if you have g++ installed).
5. The end.
