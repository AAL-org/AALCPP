# AALAN
**A**n **A**wful **L**anguage **A**midst **N**ot bad ones

---
## Two Point Oh?
Two point oh? is an attempt at making aal an actuall, somewhat passable language.

---
## Changes
For starters, we arent transpilling through Node.js anymore, we've switched to c and c++ using Flex and Bison.
We're also actually adding useful features.
Its a massive WIP, but hopefully by the end, we'll have a language that you could use if need be.

---
## What it isn't
AALAN is never going to be amazing, please dont ask or try to make it.
It's not going to be the fastest, the most optimized for ram or what have you.

Please don't expect too much.
